new_list = [True, True, False]
any(new_list)
all(new_list)
# 'any' checks if list is has at least one true element in it (in this case it will return true)
# 'all' checks to see whether all values in the list are true

when do we have a list of booleans?

number_list = [1,2,3,-5]
number_list > 0 (returns an error)
# so type like a list comphrension

e = [el for el in number list if el > 0]      [outputs --> 1, 2, 3]

# now lets set it up such that they're bigger than the other

e = [el > 0 for el in number list]      [outputs --> True, True, True, False] (for each index)


# for all elements in the list
e = all([el > 0 for el in number list])      [outputs --> False] (because not all elements in the list are greater than zero)
